**Integrating Reat with legacy  applications**

# The so feared migration

The time has arrived... After ten years developing on our beloved web technology (ASP.NET Web forms, PHP, ASP.NET MVC, Ruby...) someone from marketing department came with the following complaints about the web application:

* Some customers want to be able to work from the sofa on their mobile devices but they can't, they need to have computer around.
* Some customers cannot complete their orders.
* 30% of our customers have cheap mobile phones and our website is too heavy for them.
* When a customer is in the country-side he cannot work on our site because the connection is too slow for our application.

That translates to our "language" as:

* We have a poor web, not responsive and not adapted to mobile device interaction gestures.
* We have so much logic in spaghetti JavaScript that it's impossible to manage, same reason why our application throws unexpected errors.
* Our application is too dependant on server side tasks that could simply be done on the client side.
* Our application is too heavy and requires too much bandwidth consumption, mobile battery and resources.

The worst... this is happening with not so old technologies. Remember of Angular 1? Do you have performance issues?

Now it's time to choose. Probably your app is a massive juggernaut and you cannot just close the business for a couple years and completely migrate it.

Isn't there a way to migrate little by little?... **React to the rescue!**

# React

React is a light library for user interface rendering that has a [very good performance](https://evancz.github.io/react-angular-ember-elm-performance-comparison/),
also it allows building pages out of components. It will make it possible to replace some parts of a view and **work together with older libraries**. Let's see how:

### Approximations

One can use the following approximations for progressively migrate a legacy application with React.

* [Option 1 - Presentational React components with jQuery](#option-1)
* [Option 2 - Stateful React components with jQuery](#option-2)
* [Option 3 - Pub/Sub pattern through jQuery $.Callbacks](#option-3)
* [Option 4 - React inside MVC based Angular 1.x applications](#option-4)
* [Option 5 - React inside components based Angular 1.x applications](#option-5)

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |




### <a name="option-1">Option 1 - Presentational React components with jQuery</a>

Even though React and jQuery are two very different libraries used for solving different problems in different ways (jQuery is based on direct DOM manipulation while React aims to avoiding DOM manipulation as much as possible) they are both capable to coexist.

 A basic example would be having a module that requests server data right on initialization and pushes this data into a table rendered to the user.

![Image option 1.1](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56cdb491a3360cdd18de5e16/t/58b6fda1bebafb0976fe11ea/1488387495490/?format=750w)

We can create a small function extending jQuery prototype and allowing, for a given selector, to load a React component over that same element.

```javascript
$.fn.extend({
  react: function (Component, props, callback) {
    var mountedComponent = ReactDOM.render(
      <Component {...props} />,
      this.get(0)
    );

    if (typeof callback === 'function') {
      return callback(mountedComponent);
    }

    return mountedComponent;
  }
});
```

From now, calling the ```react``` function over a jQuery selected element, will [load](append?replace?) the passed in React component in the DOM node of the element.

For the current example we will mount the ```ContactsTableComponent``` React component with the following code:

```javascript
var ContactsTableComponent = App.components.ContactsTableComponent;
var contacts, $mountedTableComponent;

// Initialize components
var createReactComponents = function () {
  $mountedContactsTableComponent = $('#tableComponent');
  showContacts(null); // First render with no data
};

// Fill table, then mount/update React component
var showContacts = function (contacts, callback) {
  $mountedContactsTableComponent.react(ContactsTableComponent, { contacts: contacts || [] }, callback);
};
```

This implementation uses the jQuery selectors as an entry for embedding React components. The model data is stored in the page and loaded to the React component through **properties**.

And the React component definition:

```javascript
var ContactPropTypes = App.PropTypes.ContactPropTypes;
var ContactRowComponent = App.components.ContactRowComponent;

var ContactsTableComponent = function (props) {
  var contacts = props.contacts || [];
  return (
    <table className="table table-stripped table-bordered table-hover">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Phone number</th>
          <th>Email</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {contacts.map(function (contact, index) {
          return <ContactRowComponent key={index} contact={contact} />;
        })}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

ContactsTableComponent.displayName = 'ContactsTableComponent';
ContactsTableComponent.propTypes = {
  contacts: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(ContactPropTypes)
};
```

This way, when responding to an AJAX request for the component data, it can get updated by calling the ```showContacts``` function with the response data:

```javascript
var fetchContacts = function () {
  $.when(contactsService.fetchContacts())
    .then(function (fetchedContacts) {
    showContacts(fetchedContacts);
  });
};
```

![Image Option 1.2](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56cdb491a3360cdd18de5e16/t/58b700859f74569e0581b942/1488388248574/?format=750w)


| This example source code is available at [02 Props and Render](https://github.com/Lemoncode/integrate-react-legacy-apps/tree/master/02%20Props%20and%20Render)     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |


### <a name="option-2">Option 2 - Stateful React components with jQuery</a>

When we work with components it is usual to have components with more presentation logic and need to store an internal state. These are commonly named **container components**. A container component is just a component in charge of managing the state of a part of the application, in other words, it's in charge of business logic.

 From jQuery we could then execute more actions apart from mounting, as accessing component properties and public methods, allowing component state changes.

Then we would change ```showContacts``` function implementation as:

```javascript
var ContactsTableContainer = App.components.ContactsTableContainer;
var contacts, $mountedContactsTableContainer;

var createReactComponents = function () {
    $mountedContactsTableContainer = $('#tableComponent').react(ContactsTableContainer, null);
};

var showContacts = function (contacts, callback) {
  // Accessing React component API methods
  $mountedContactsTableContainer.setState({ contacts: contacts });
};
```

In this case the component instance, mounted by ReactDOM is stored in a variable. This way we can call it's method setState to modify the state.
 It's important to mention that this call could be perfectly encapsulated in a public method implemented to do some validations right before changing the state.

 This option can be useful in some scenarios, but it's not the best case scenario, since calling some lifecycle methods [in a wrong way](this needs explanation) can have unexpected effects.

 It is more common that the React components are those who interact with each other through the methods inside their input properties.

 ![Image Option 2.1](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56cdb491a3360cdd18de5e16/t/58b7019c29687f41be932a36/1488388521762/?format=750w)

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

### <a name="option-3">Option 3 - Pub/Sub pattern through jQuery $.Callbacks</a>

Publish-Subscribe pattern can be very useful for communicating React with jQuery since the actions sent by the communication channels can be sent to those functions subscribed to the channel without knowing anything about the rest of he listeners. Let's see how we could add a simple implementation of the Pub/Sub pattern by a method that can be accessed via jQuery:

```javascript
$.observe = (function () {
  var subjects = {};
  return function (id) {
    var callbacks;
    var subject = id && subjects[id];

    if (!subject) {
      callbacks = $.Callbacks();
      subject = {
        publish: callbacks.fire,
        subscribe: callbacks.add,
        unsubscribe: callbacks.remove
      };
     if (id) {
        subjects[id] = subject;
      }
    }
    return subject;
  };
})();
```

The ```subject``` object stores the communication channel and exposes the *publish*, *subscribe* and *unsubscribe* actions.
In this pattern implementation, React components subscribe and un-subscribe to the communication channel inside the ```componentDidMount``` and ```componentWillUnmount``` lifecycle methods.

```javascript
var ContactPropTypes = App.PropTypes.ContactPropTypes;
var ContactsTableComponent = App.components.ContactsTableComponent;

var ContactsTableContainer = React.createClass({
  displayName: 'ContactsTableContainer',
  onAddContact: function (contact) {
    this.setState({
      contacts: this.state.contacts.concat(contact)
    });
  },
  componentDidMount: function () {
    $.observe('addContacts').subscribe(this.onAddContact);
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function () {
    $.observe('addContacts').unsubscribe(this.onAddContact);
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      contacts: []
    };
  },
  render: function () {
    return <ContactsTableComponent contacts={this.state.contacts} />;
  }
});
```

The component exposes a method, in this case the ```onAddContact``` method, that modifies the component state when $.observe('<channel-name>').publish method is called where <channel-name> is 'addContacts'. This way, when our application needs to change the component state, we just have to send the data through this channel. As an example:

 ```javascript
var fetchContacts = function () {
  $.when(contactsService.fetchContacts())
    .then(function (fetchedContacts) {
      contacts = fetchedContacts;
      $.observe('addContacts').publish(contacts);
    });
};
 ```

And when publishing to 'addContacts' channel, the contacts are received through the ```onAddContact``` method, changing its state and activating its lifecycle events like ```render``` resulting in an HTML change.

By using this pattern, it is not necessary to store component instances in the module.

```javascript
var ContactsTableContainer = App.components.ContactsTableContainer;
var contacts;

var createReactComponents = function () {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <ContactsTableContainer />,
    $('#tableComponent').get(0)
  );
};
```

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |


### <a name="option-4">Option 4 - React inside Angular 1.x with MVC architecture</a>

AngularJS allows components creation as a directive and it makes it easier to integrate React components thanks to the ngReact library that provides the ```react-component``` directive and the ```reactDirective``` factory.

 We will demonstrate with a small example where we have a small form requesting data to be codified in base64. We will integrate a React component to show its result by using ```react-component```:

##### Form (index.html)

 ```html
<section ng-controller="Main as ctrl">
  <form class="col-md-5" action="#" ng-submit="ctrl.encode($event)">
    <h3>Base64 encoder</h3>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="txtMessage">Encode a text</label>
      <input type="text" class="form-control" id="txtMessage" ng-model="ctrl.text" placeholder="Message to encode">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Encode</button>
    </div>
  </form>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <!-- React Component here to visualize encoded text -->
  </div>
</section>
 ```

##### App module

We create the module with a dependency of ngReact.
```
angular.module('app', ['react']);
```

##### Controller

And the controller to store the model.
```javascript
// src/controllers/main-controller.js
function Main() {
  var self = this;
  self.text = '';
  self.encodedText = '';
  self.encode = function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    self.encodedText = btoa(self.text);
    self.text = '';
  };
}
angular.module('app').controller('Main', [Main]);
```

##### React component

And finally the React component that will receive the codified text through ```props``` properties.

```javascript
var ShowEncoded = function (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4><strong>Encoded text</strong></h4>
      <pre>{props.encoded || 'Nothing written'}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

ShowEncoded.propTypes = {
  encoded: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

// Store React component in Angular module
angular.module('app').value('ShowEncoded', ShowEncoded);
```

##### Calling the component
To call the component we just have to add the react-component tag in the form as:

```html
<react-component name="ShowEncoded" props="{encoded: ctrl.encodedText}" watch-depth="reference" />
```

Internally ngReact delegates the model properties to the component through ```props``` attribute when they change, making it to be updated. Quite simple, right?

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

Another way to add a component to our Angular application is changing the component export using ngReact ```reactDirective``` factory.

```javascript
// AngularJS directive definition
var showEncoded = function (reactDirective) {
  return reactDirective(ShowEncoded);
};

angular.module('app').directive('showEncoded', ['reactDirective', showEncoded]);
```

This way our component can be added to the form as:

```html
<show-encoded encoded="ctrl.encodedText" watch-depth="reference" />
```

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |


### <a name="option-5">Option 5 - React inside components based Angular 1.x applications</a>

From Angular 1.5 it is possible to use angular.component to make our app out of components. The application can be based on components that work as small reusable pieces.
We'll picture this with an example of an acordion component built in Angular that we want to migrate to React.

### Acordion Controller

```javascript
function AccordionController() {
  var self = this;
  var panels = [];

  self.addPanel = function (panel) {
    panels.push(panel);
    if (panels.length) {
      panels[0].show();
    }
  };

  self.select = function (selectedPanel) {
    panels.forEach(function (panel) {
      if (panel === selectedPanel) {
        panel.show();
      } else {
        panel.hide();
      }
    });
  };
}

angular
  .module('app')
  .component('accordion', {
    bindings: {
      feeds: '<'
    },
    templateUrl: './dist/components/accordion/accordion.html',
    controller: AccordionController
  });
```

##### Accordion Template

```html
<!-- components/accordion/accordion.html -->
<div class="panel-group" role="tablist">
  <accordion-panel ng-repeat="feed in $ctrl.feeds track by $index" feed="feed" />
</div>
```

This accordion will render a set of panels containing the received feeds from a parent component. The panel is just another reusable component with a controller and a template defined as:

```javascript
function AccordionPanel() {
  var self = this;
  var selected = false;

  self.$onInit = function () {
    self.parent.addPanel(self);
  };

  self.select = function () {
    self.parent.select(self);
  };

  self.show = function () {
    if (selected) {
      self.hide();
    } else {
      selected = true;
      self.active = 'in';
    }
  };

  self.hide = function () {
    selected = false;
    self.active = '';
  };
}

angular
  .module('app')
  .component('accordionPanel', {
    bindings: {
      feed: '<'
    },
    require: {
      parent: '^accordion'
    },
    templateUrl: './dist/components/accordion/accordion-panel/accordion-panel.html',
    controller: AccordionPanel
  });
```

##### AccordionPanel Template

```html
<!-- components/accordion/accordion-panel.html -->
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" style="cursor: pointer" ng-click="$ctrl.select()" role="panel">
    <h3 class="panel-title">{{$ctrl.feed.heading}}</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body collapsible" ng-class="$ctrl.active">
    <p class="feed-content">{{$ctrl.feed.content}}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### Use of the component

```
<main class="container">
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <accordion feeds="$ctrl.feeds" />
  </div>
</main>
```

#### React migration

Let's see how the accordion could be replaced by a React component

```javascript
var Accordion = function (AccordionPanel) {
  return React.createClass({
    displayName: 'Accordion',
    getInitialState: function () {
      return {
        selected: null
      };
    },
    render: function () {
      var feeds = this.props.feeds || [];
      var selected = this.state.selected;
      var self = this;
      return (
        <div className="panel-group" role="tablist">
          <h1>{this.props.foo}</h1>
          {feeds.map(function (feed, index) {
            return (
              <AccordionPanel
                active={selected === feed.id}
                onSelect={self.select}
                key={index}
                feed-id={index}
                feed={feed}
              />
            );
          })}
        </div>
      );
    },
    select: function (selected) {
      if (selected === this.state.selected) {
        selected = null;
      }
      this.setState({ selected });
    }
  });
}

angular
  .module('app')
  .factory('Accordion', ['AccordionPanel', Accordion]);
```

##### React Accordion Panel

```javascript
function AccordionPanel(props) {
  var select = function () {
    return props.onSelect(props.feed.id);
  };
  var className = 'panel-body collapsible';
  if (props.active) {
    className += ' in';
  }
  return (
    <div className="panel panel-default">
      <div className="panel-heading" style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }} onClick={select} role="panel">
        <h3 className="panel-title">{props.feed.heading}</h3>
      </div>
      <div className={className}>
        <p className="feed-content">{props.feed.content}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

AccordionPanel.displayName = 'AccordionPanel';
AccordionPanel.propTypes = {
  active: React.PropTypes.bool,
  onSelect: React.PropTypes.func,
  feed: React.PropTypes.shape({
    id: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    heading: React.PropTypes.string,
    content: React.PropTypes.string
  })
};

angular
  .module('app')
  .value('AccordionPanel', AccordionPanel);
```

##### Use

```html
<main class="container">
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <react-component name="Accordion" props="{feeds: $ctrl.feeds}" watch-depth="reference" />
  </div>
</main>
```

## Conclusion

React is a very complete and high performance library that allows very modular and scalable development, also it brings great tools for easier development like [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) or testing libraries like [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) or [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to ensure application quality.
Even though React itself does not provide all application parts, we have an available ecosystem that perfectly fit and cover all application development scopes like [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for managing application state or [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing and synchronizing components with navigation. Furthermore, one can reuse components to build hybrid applications with [React Native.](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
# Integrate React legacy apps
The goal of this project is provide a set of samples covering concepts to migrate from a legacy app to React.

## 00 Boilerplate

Initial setup for an ES5 web application using jQuery, namespacing and module pattern. This sample shows a simple table with mocked data.

## 01.A Basic Integration

This sample replaces the table from previous sample using `React.createElement` without transpilation.

## 01.B Move To JSX

This sample shows how to move the React component from previous sample to JSX syntax and configure Gulp to set up automatic transpilation.

## 02 Props and Render

This sample covers basic communication between jQuery and React using `React.render` to update the component properties. A form is created to add more records to the table.

## 03 Stateful Component

This sample changes the component from previous sample to use the state istead of properties. The goal of this samples is to show we can use methods from component directly.

## 04 Event Emitter

This sample shows how to use Publish/Subscribe pattern with `jQuery.Callbacks()` method to create a communcation layer between jQuery and React as event emitters.

## 05.A Angular controllerAS & directive

This sample shows a basic Angular form and uses a React component to display a piece of the Angular model. It uses [ngReact](https://github.com/ngReact/ngReact) to use a directive that wrapps the React component.

## 05.B Angular controllerAS & factory

This sampl is based on the previous sample to show how to use ngReact library to expose the React component using the ngReact *reactDirective* factory.

## 05.C Angular components & directive

This sample uses how to replace an accordion of a web component based Angular application with a React accordion. it also uses ngReact for libraries communication.
